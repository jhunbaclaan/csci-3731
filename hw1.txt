1. rm -r * = remove all directories. on linux, you won't be prompted for confirmation, and after execution you can't undo the changes.
if executed on the root folder, you practically brick your computer and render it unusable.

2. compiling is the first step you need to execute a .cc file. it turns that .cc file into a .o file, converting the source code into some machine language.
linking comes directly after compiling. this turns the .o file from before into a .exe (or .app on mac), which allows the program to be executed.
